# RestaurantInsightAI
**RestaurantInsightAI** is a data science project from the Cognifyz internship that analyzes restaurant data using Python. It covers three levels: exploratory analysis, descriptive insights, and predictive modeling. It uses `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and includes a full `README.md` for setup and usage.
